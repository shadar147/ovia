# Ovia — Business Vision

## Problem
Teams use Jira, GitLab, and Confluence in parallel, but insights are fragmented:
- no single source of delivery truth
- reporting is manual and delayed
- management asks cross-system questions that are hard to answer quickly
- operational risks are discovered too late

## Product thesis
Ovia is an engineering intelligence layer that unifies operational data, delivery signals, and team knowledge into one queryable context.

## Core value
1. **Time-to-insight drops from days to minutes**
2. **Delivery risk becomes visible earlier**
3. **Leadership gets objective, consistent reporting**
4. **Teams spend less time preparing status updates**

## Target users
- CTO / VP Engineering
- Engineering managers
- Product managers
- Tech leads
- PMO / operations analysts

## Key outcomes (business KPIs)
- Faster release decision cycles
- Reduced cycle time variability
- Better predictability of delivery dates
- Fewer unresolved blockers across teams
- Lower manual reporting effort

## Positioning
Ovia is not “just a dashboard” and not “just a chatbot”.
It combines:
- trusted data ingestion,
- normalized analytics,
- explainable Q&A over operational context.

# Solution Overview

## Scope (initial)
Data sources:
- Jira (issues, statuses, assignees, sprints, comments)
- GitLab (projects, merge requests, commits, pipelines, approvals)
- Confluence (pages, spaces, comments)

Capabilities:
- unified data model
- analytics and trend reporting
- natural-language Q&A over synchronized context
- scheduled summaries and proactive alerts

## Main use cases
1. “Why did velocity drop this sprint?”
2. “What is blocking release X?”
3. “Which MRs are stale and impact roadmap items?”
4. “Summarize all decisions from Confluence related to initiative Y.”
5. “Give weekly executive status for mobile apps A/B/C.”

## Non-goals (MVP)
- write-back automation to Jira/GitLab by default
- deep BI custom report builder UI
- full enterprise SSO/SCIM in first iteration
